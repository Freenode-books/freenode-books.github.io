<h1>The ##booksndragons webpage</h1>

<h2>Basic world background</h2>
<p>It's a magic-poor fantasy setting, and elves are the only peoples that are naturally magic, and that magic gets infused into all they do, making it supernaturally superb. A strange plague hits the elven lands killing all elves that go there, and shortly after the other peoples move in and take all their cool stuff. "There's no reason not to 'preserve' it, right?" The few surviving elves get 'sanctuary' on a remote island, to "keep them safe from the plague". The idea would be for the PCs to be a mixed group of elves that want to leave the island and investigate things, in the hopes of finding a way for them to get home and possibly avenge the theft and destruction brought on by the other peoples.</p>
