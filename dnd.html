<h1>The ##booksndragons webpage</h1>
<h2>CAMPAIGN INFO</h2>
<p>It's a magic-poor fantasy setting, and elves are the only peoples that are naturally magic, and that magic gets infused into all they do, making it supernaturally superb.</p>
<p>A strange plague hits the elven lands killing all elves that go there (two thirds dead within a week, less than one in a thousand left after a month), and shortly after the other peoples move in and take all their cool stuff. "There's no reason not to 'preserve' it, right?"</p>
<p>The few surviving elves get 'sanctuary' on a remote island, to "keep them safe from the plague".</p>
<p>The idea would be for the PCs to be a mixed group of elves that want to leave the island and investigate things, in the hopes of finding a way for them to get home and possibly avenge the theft and destruction brought on by the other peoples.</p>
 
<h2>SETTING INFO</h2>
  <h3>The Elven Trinity</h3>
<p>Three sister goddesses that embody aspects of nature and existence. Split the elven race into three and reforged the elves in their own images hoping to stop the endless series of civil wars.</p>
<p>Sylai-thaal, creation & renewal, wood elves, favours primal talents,</p>
<p>Mylan-thaal, preservation & protection, high elves, favours arcane talents,</p>
<p>Ghilan-thaal, disruption & dismantling, dark elves, favours martial talents,</p>
<p>*The -thaal is a honorific, and can be dropped in casual conversation (like swearing: By Ghilan!)</p>
 
<h2>CHAR GEN INFO</h2>
<p>the player's handbook or an SRD will be fine, no other books needed</p>
<p>Nothing too weird. If it might be an edge case, then make up a good story and try to sell me on it.</p>
<p>Use the standard array for stats, it should work just fine.</p>
<p>I would recommend picking a background before you do the class stuff. It's a bit easier that way, not sure why WotC put that afterwards...</p>
<p>You'll all be pretty normal elves that just happened to survive the plage, but since you're all partly magical and have lived for hundreds of years I've been thinking about starting you out at maybe lvl 3 or so...</p>
<p>Max HP on first level, then take the average. It's simpler that way.</p>
<p>Since they PCs are exiled to a remote island far away from anything they'll start with pretty much only the clothes, and possibly a few personal belongings. Why would the other races let you be armed and ready for a fight?</p>
 
<h2>PLAYER INFO</h2>
<p>GridCube: ranger,</p>
<p>nalkri: wizard?, Arcane Trickster?, sailor with a pet cat,</p>
<p>Staretta: ?</p>
<p>CrystalNice: ?</p>
<p>deznuts: ?</p>
 
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>This kinda takes the old gaming trope "kill everything and take their stuff" and points it towards a PC race. It starts off with genocide, and racism will probably be common. Things can get kinda dark, so we will have to be careful to balance it with some positive stuff.</p>
