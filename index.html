		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68811.Momo">Momo <i>by Michael Ende</i></a> <sub>#fantasy #YA #classic #1of1</sub></li></ul>
			<p><sub>	The sinister men in grey have arrived and are silently taking over the city. They are drawing life-blood from the unsuspecting inhabitants. They are the time-thieves. It is Momo, the ragged little waif, who discovers what is happening. And it is Momo, with her uncanny ability to listen, her simplicity and honesty, who holds the key to salvation. She is the only one who can resist these soulless, corrupt creatures. In this intricate and compelling story of a fantastic country, Momo sets out to destroy the enemy. The mysterious Professor Hora and his strangely gifted tortoise, Cassiopeia, will help her.</sub>	</p>

			<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139986.The_Snow_Queen">The Snow Queen <i>by Joan D. Vinge</i></a> <sub>#scifi #space opera #1of3</sub></li></ul>
			<p><sub>	The imperious Winter colonists have ruled the planet Tiamat for 150 years, deriving wealth from the slaughter of the sea mers. But soon the galactic stargate will close, isolating Tiamat, and the 150-year reign of the Summer primitives will begin. Their only chance at surviving the change is if Arienrhod, the ageless, corrupt Snow Queen, can destroy destiny with an act of genocide. Arienrhod is not without competition as Moon, a young Summer-tribe sibyl, and the nemesis of the Snow Queen, battles to break a conspiracy that spans space. Interstellar politics, a millennia-long secret conspiracy, and a civilization whose hidden machineries might still control the fate of worlds.</sub></p>
			<ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12013.Excession">Excession <i>by Iain Banks</i></a> <sub>#scifi #5of10</sub></li></ul>
			<p><sub>	The Culture's espionage and dirty tricks section orders Diplomat Byr Gen-Hofoen to steal the soul of a long-dead starship captain. By accepting the mission, Byr irrevocably plunges himself into a conspiracy: one that could either lead the universe into an age of peace or to the brink of annihilation.</sub></p>
			<ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion">Hyperion <i>by Dan Simmons</i></a> <sub>#scifi #1of4</sub></li></ul>
			<p><sub>	On the world called Hyperion, beyond the law of the Hegemony of Man, there waits the creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives. Each carries a desperate hope—and a terrible secret. And one may hold the fate of humanity in his hands. </sub></p>
			<ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359375.Night_Watch"> Night Watch <i>by Sergei Lukyanenko</i></a> <sub> #urban fantasy #1of6</sub></li></ul>
			<p><sub>	The agents of the Dark – the Night Watch – oversee nocturnal activity, while the agents of the Light keep watch over the day. For a thousand years both sides have maintained a precarious balance of power, but an ancient prophecy has decreed that a supreme Other will one day emerge, threatening to tip the scales.</sub></p>

			<ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73973.Changes">Changes <i>by Ama Ata Aidoo</i></a> <sub>#african literature #fiction</sub></li></ul>
			<p><sub> Esi decides to divorce after enduring yet another morning's marital rape. Though her friends and family remain baffled by her decision (after all, he doesn't beat her!), Esi holds fast. When she falls in love with a married man—wealthy, and able to arrange a polygamous marriage—the modern woman finds herself trapped in a new set of problems. Witty and compelling, Aidoo's novel, "inaugurates a new realist style in African literature."</sub></p>
			<ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6185.Wuthering_Heights"> Wuthering Heights <i>by Emily Brontë</i></a> <sub>#classic</sub></li></ul>
			<p><sub> Wuthering Heights is a wild, passionate story of the intense and almost demonic love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by Catherine's father. After Mr Earnshaw's death, Heathcliff is bullied and humiliated by Catherine's brother Hindley and wrongly believing that his love for Catherine is not reciprocated, leaves Wuthering Heights, only to return years later as a wealthy and polished man. He proceeds to exact a terrible revenge for his former miseries. The action of the story is chaotic and unremittingly violent, but the accomplished handling of a complex structure, the evocative descriptions of the lonely moorland setting and the poetic grandeur of vision combine to make this unique novel a masterpiece of English literature.</sub></p>
			<ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122519.African_Psycho"> African Psycho <i>by Alain Mabanckou</i></a></li></ul>
			<p><sub> Its title recalls Bret Easton Ellis’s infamous book, but while Ellis’s narrator was a blank slate, African Psycho’s protagonist is a quivering mass of lies, neuroses, and relentless internal chatter. Gregoire Nakobomayo, a petty criminal, has decided to kill his girlfriend Germaine. He’s planned the crime for some time, but still, the act of murder requires a bit of psychological and logistical preparation. Luckily, he has a mentor to call on, the far more accomplished serial killer Angoualima. The fact that Angoualima is dead doesn’t prevent Gregoire from holding lengthy conversations with him. Little by little, Gregoire interweaves Angoualima’s life and criminal exploits with his own. Continuing with the plan despite a string of botched attempts, Gregoire’s final shot at offing Germaine leads to an abrupt unraveling. Lauded in France for its fresh and witty style, African Psycho’s inventive use of language surprises and relieves the reader by injecting humor into this disturbing subject.</sub></p>
			<ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15818107-orphan-train"> Orphan Train <i>by Christina Baker Kline</i></a></li></ul>
			<p><sub>Rich in detail and epic in scope, Orphan Train is a powerful novel of upheaval and resilience, of second chances, of unexpected friendship, and of the secrets we carry that keep us from finding out who we are.</sub></p>
			<ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10210.Jane_Eyre"> Jane Eyre <i>by Charlotte Brontë</i></a></li></ul>
			<p><sub> Orphaned into the household of her Aunt Reed at Gateshead, subject to the cruel regime at Lowood charity school, Jane Eyre nonetheless emerges unbroken in spirit and integrity. She takes up the post of governess at Thornfield, falls in love with Mr. Rochester, and discovers the impediment to their lawful marriage in a story that transcends melodrama to portray a woman's passionate search for a wider and richer life than Victorian society traditionally allowed.</sub></p>
